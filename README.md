# This script shows the total number of unread emails in a specific account. It can be altered to show the contents of each email.

# Reason for making
- Being a part of different volunteer and student groups, I have recieved email accounts that rarely recieve any emails. For these accounra, I did not want to add them to my default mail app, so, I decided to create a very short script that will allow me to check to see if there are any un-read emails in a specified account and I will be able to open the mailbox only if required.

# Notes
- For Gmail specifically, you must give access to less secure apps in order for imaplib to access your acount.
